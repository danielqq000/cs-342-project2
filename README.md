### DESCRIPTION  
This project is an implementation of the popular casino game Keno. Players are welcomed, are informed of the rules and odds, and can then begin play. Players can choose the number of slots and number of rounds to play. They can then either choose numbers on the board or have an auto picker select. The game will then draw 20 numbers, and numbers that match will produce winnings.
